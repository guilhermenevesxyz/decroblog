			<h2>My Reflections on The Meaning of Life</h2>
			
			<p>published on October 05, 2022</p>
			
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			
			<p>
				<i>Nihilism</i> is a funny-looking word.
				The first time I saw it, I may have thought of earthworms or something similar.
				In fact, it has nothing to do with any kind of worms.
				The etymology for this word is rather simple;
				it can be set apart into two different pieces of meaning,
				the first one being <i>nihil</i>, from Latin, meaning <i>nothing</i>,
				and the second one being the suffix <i>-ism</i>,
				which you are probably already familiar with.
				It expresses a type of doctrine or practice.
				Its origin points to Greek, the language of philosophy.
				In this field, the use of this suffix is frequently spotted in the names of doctrines such as
				Skepticism, Utilitarianism and, well, <i>Nihilism</i>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The use of Latin and Greek terms in English is not something to be impressed by.
				It happens so often, in fact,
				that the majority of English vocabulary is not even Anglo-Saxon, but <i>Latin</i>.
				Most of it was imported from French or, more precisely, <i>Norman French</i>,
				during the Norman Conquest of England.
				It's fun because the Normans were vikings speaking a viking dialect of French.
				An interesting fact about this is that
				the Norman dialect of French did not replace English completely and
				the rural population was still speaking mostly "pure" English during these times,
				resulting in words from different backgrounds meaning the same things.
				One example is the words <i>pig</i>, to designate the animal the farmers were raising,
				and <i>pork</i>, which is just pig prepared to be eaten.
				This shows us that the French vocabulary is not used so much in the core parts of speech
				and is instead concentrated in some field-specific technical terms.
				These have been used more and more nowadays,
				making the English language a true hybrid between the Germanic and Latin backgrounds.
				Just like Latin, <i>Greek</i> has also influenced the English language,
				bringing some technical words into it.
				In fact, even languages that evolved from Latin have a lot of Greek terms in them.
				Words like these tend to be very similar across different languages
				because of this massive sharing of vocabulary that occurred throughout history.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Back to Nihilism. Etymologically, the word is rich, yet easy to understand.
				But what about <i>actual meaning</i>?
				The etymological roots of the word give us a hint to its meaning.
				Generally, this is true for most words.
				After all, the word was constructed to be used in an intuitive manner.
				Why would anyone invent a word by joining the terms for
				<i>slug</i> and <i>rock</i> to describe
				<i>the itch one gets as earwax moves through the ear canal</i>?
				It would be very misleading and not any practical.
				Therefore, words tend to be tied closely to their etymologically assumed meaning (but not always).
				In this particular case, it is.
				Nihilism is the belief that nothing is meaningful or, in other words,
				<i>everything is meaningless</i>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				It all boils down to possibly the oldest and deepest
				philosophical question ever asked by human beings — "What is the meaning of life?"
				Many believe this question to represent the transition from irrational to rational beings.
				The awareness of existence and the endless search for a meaning to justify everything one does.
				You don't see fish questioning their existence;
				asking "why should I keep swimming? What is the point?"
				They simply don't seem to care about such things.
				Maybe they're happier this way... Who knows?
				I would never think of fish as particularly rational creatures,
				but maybe they are the ones who have figured it all out...
				They seem to live happy lives without any deep questions.
				Perhaps this meaninglessness is what makes us humans so hopeless;
				the lack of a purpose is daunting.
				Yet, no one could ever answer this very question with certainty;
				we are still waiting for a definitive answer.
				There has been a lot of attempts since we first asked it...
				Some of them remained as the most accepted ones...
				some of these are disappointing, unsatisfactory or even unacceptable;
				others don't even answer the question at all.
				Nevertheless, they are all we have, for now.
				We don't even know if there is a way to find the desired meaning,
				or even a meaning to be found. This is what Nihilism explores.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Nihilism in Religion</h3>
			
			<p>
				I have not — by any means — had contact with all the religions in the world;
				nor have I had contact with the majority of them, at least; only a few.
				As a European, the most prominent one was, of course, <i>Christianity</i>.
				Specifically, the <i>Roman Catholic Church</i> — there are many branches.
				I do know the other branches, to a certain extent,
				as well as a few other completely different religions, like everyone else does.
				My knowledge on the topic might not be the widest possible,
				but I have never seen any religion in which our lives simply had no purpose.
				All of them promise something to happen at the end, justifying, in some way,
				our existence. In other words,
				I don't know of any <i>purely nihilistic</i> religion.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Although Nihilism and religion seem to me like inherently incompatible concepts
				(this being reënforced by the fact that many religions seem to condemn nihilistic beliefs),
				it does not eliminate them completely.
				Let's imagine that someone believes in
				the existence of God — a supreme entity who created the entirety of the Universe — and that,
				after their death, they shall be judged according to the morality of their actions,
				ending up being conceded a different destiny depending on that.
				(This is more or less a description of Catholicism.)
				This person then thinks of life itself as a test;
				a way of separating those who act according to the assumed correct moral values
				from those who don't. This would be the meaning of life...
				Or maybe not. This view becomes superficial when the fact that
				this same person believes in afterlife is taken into account.
				Afterlife implies that life is just a stage in a full existence,
				meaning that life is not actually the full life.
				The question remains — what's the meaning of it all? Why is God selecting people?
				For what purpose? What shall they do in their afterlife?
				They don't need to work or eat or have children and take care of them, right?
				So what shall they do?" One could still easily have nihilistic beliefs,
				even being religious, since the question remains to be answered.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Most religions' takes on the meaning of life tell us it is about loving and serving
				God and His wishes or some variation of that.
				Why should we do it, though? There must be a reason for that.
				I have had this conversation with a few religious people and, at this point,
				they just give up and tell me they have no idea about what the meaning is and that
				it remains a mystery to be solved.
				Unfortunately, this is, of course, not the answer I am looking for.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Enjoyment as a Meaning</h3>
			
			<p>
				Most people will tell me the meaning of life is the <i>enjoyment</i> one gets from it.
				We are here to have fun, in other words.
				To me, this doesn't make any sense. Who put us here to have fun? And why?
				What does a bunch of people having fun affect positively?
				Besides, some people don't actually have fun and live monotonous and depressing lives;
				are they just missing the purpose?
				Why would one build an anvil out of paper if it doesn't serve its purpose?
				Likewise, why are all these people here when they are not
				actually enjoying their lives then?
				If you think about it, this is a very meaningless meaning to life.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				We are constantly dying and being replaced by newborns.
				Why generating more people to also "have fun"?
				They might even be born with disabilities and such things,
				many times taking their possibilities of having fun away from them.
				Why should we keep raising offspring? Many even choose not to.
				This is supposedly the <b>only</b> goal other species have in
				the wholeness of their existences;
				meanwhile, we, humans, sometimes choose to replace this goal with
				other goals we find more important.
				This might be making it even more difficult to find an actual meaning,
				since we don't even share the same purposes anymore.
				Ironically, earthworms would have a much easier time reflecting on
				the meaning of their lives than we do.
				On the other hand, this might as well be a positive influence on our endless research.
				It helps us see the bigger picture and not be limited to
				that stereotypical view on life which consists of
				reproducing endlessly and making our species thrive in a certain environment.
				This — having other goals beyond contributing to the spreading of our lineage — could,
				thus, be seen as a positive or negative distraction,
				when it comes to finding the answer to this question.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The biggest problem, in my opinion, is that
				human beings tend to think of themselves as being more important than
				everything else.
				Guess what? We are made of the same basic units as rocks — molecules.
				Humans, rocks and all the other entities are part of the universe.
				Looking at it this way, none of them is more important than the others.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Ultimately, Life Has the Meaning YOU Give It</h3>
			
			<p>
				This is the point where everyone gives up.
				People just don't want to think about this any longer and decide that
				life has the meaning one wants to give to it.
				Ultimately, no one cares if you have a happy life or not in the long term;
				it's none of universe's business.
				It seems like everything will, eventually, be <i>completely forgotten</i>;
				not just by you, but everyone around you.
				If you live a happy life, that's good for you. Or... Is it?
				In the end, it doesn't matter.
				Having a sad existence is exactly the same to the universe as being the happiest;
				it's just molecules moving around anyway.
				This can make one reflect for hours and hours.
				Up until now, no one has ever come out of this reflexion with a definitive answer.
				The most realistic one to me is Nihilism, for now;
				it might be different for you.
				Whatever you think about this, it's probably not the actual truth.
				We are still learning about this stuff and, let's be honest,
				<i>we still have no clue</i>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				So the most reasonable answer to this is that <i>it doesn't matter</i>.
				As there is no definitive answer,
				the meaning of life is always going to be the one one thinks it is,
				at least inside their head.
				Do whatever you like to do while letting the others do so as well.
				It's uncertain whether it's going to be worth it,
				but it feels good in the short-term anyway.
				Since you're here, you may as well explore the site and
				enjoy it till the end of your stay.
				Think of the fish and earthworms;
				they seem to live happy lives without having a clue about what's going on.
				So can you and everyone else.
				Keep searching for a meaning, but don't let the absence of one discourage you.
