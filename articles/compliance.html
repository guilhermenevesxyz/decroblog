			<h2>Compliance is Not a Virtue</h2>
			
			<p>published on October 21, 2022</p>
			
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			
			<p>
				Let's be honest. Who likes to be submissive?
				Sexual fantasies aside, it's not something we tend to enjoy so much.
				We do it as a means to achieve some kind of reward at the end.
				For example, a child might obey their parents in order to not get grounded.
				At first, this sounds like a beneficial interaction;
				the parents are happy for the child behaves;
				the child is happy for they don't get grounded.
				However, this can lead to some problems...
			</p>
			
			<h3>The Problems</h3>
			
			<p>
				The first problem starts when the child grows up and wants to obtain something;
				the assimilated reaction will then be to try to please someone by serving them and being submissive.
				If one's always told what to do, when to do it and how to do it,
				how can they develop the ability to think for themselves?
				If you're just executing tasks, without ever questioning what you're doing,
				whether it's the right time to do it or if it's the best way to do it,
				then you're no more human than a washing machine.
				Washing machines don't do anything but obeying till they can't take it anymore — <i>id est</i>,
				when they stop functioning because of some technical problem.
				The creativity that allows one to find a different solution to a given issue and
				think out-of-the-box is completely lost.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The second problem derives from the first one.
				Not being able to evaluate the task one's given and determine whether it's going to be positive or
				negative to do it will definitely cause problems at some point.
				Think of a dog who sits or lies down as they're told in order to be fed.
				Even though this is innocent and harmless,
				a naïve child could easily be convinced to engage in sexual activities with adults by
				using the exact same technique.
				Compliance can lead to easy manipulation, which may be very dangerous.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			
			<p>
				In my opinion, we should stop valuing this trait and favour creative-thinking over it.
				Finding new solutions to existing problems or even new problems is actually the better trait/skill.
				Compliance is, in my view, going out-of-fashion.
