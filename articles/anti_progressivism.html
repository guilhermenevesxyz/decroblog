			<h2>On Anti-Progressivism</h2>
			
			<p>published on October 14, 2022</p>
			
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			
			<p>
				I've been hearing people talk about the "good ol' times" since I learned how to speak.
				Each generation thinks about the newer one as being worse, for some reason;
				not as tough, not as respectful, not as intelligent...
				Long story short, generally less capable.
				Interestingly enough,
				the newer generation thinks exactly the same about the older one;
				it's mutual.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				One can look at this in three different ways: either the former,
				the latter or neither of them is right.
				One's view will often depend on the generation they actually belong to.
				It is, at the very least, a strong inclination to take into account.
				As a <i>zoomer</i>, — an individual born in Generation-Z,
				<i>id est</i> between 1997 and 2012 — I shall be reviewing
				some of the anti-progressivist elders' stereotypical thoughts,
				which don't make much sense to me,
				having been raised in a technologically developed world while,
				in contrast, they saw a completely different reality,
				consisting of more traditions and <i>no electricity</i>.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Life Now and Life Then</h3>
			
			<p>
				Today, we can enjoy many things our ancestors didn't take for granted.
				I don't need to get into famine and water shortages,
				as that's what everyone already thinks about.
				What's important to consider is that they didn't have anything too unnatural back then.
				Electricity and artificial heat and light is something more recent than
				we even bother to imagine — yes, it's true that it was a thing in big cities;
				however, we can't think of that as the norm,
				as a lot more people were inhabiting small villages at that time compared to nowadays;
				these didn't have any electricity as they do now.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				It's strange 'cause we think of TV as something that old people have fun with,
				yet TV was not available for most of the rural populations until the early 80's.
				When I ask my grandparents how they used to spend their free time,
				they tell me they would go to the church, village parties, local cafés <i>et cæteræ</i>.
				The youngsters would play football with self-crafted balls or
				just talk to each other about their everyday lives.
				I can't imagine how anyone could ever think of this as a fun way of living,
				but that is what they think about playing videogames and watching videos online.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Healthcare was very limited in these rural areas as well.
				There was one or two doctors per village, likely not very knowledgeable.
				No ambulances to call, no medications to buy and, especially,
				no mental-disorder recognition.
				Mental-illness would be treated with skepticism and devalorisation.
				They seem to prefer this, though.
				"People were healthier back then." — they say — "Their food was not
				genetically modified to increase production revenue and their immune systems were
				strengthened from playing outside as kids."
				Believe it or not, they used to <i>touch grass</i>. Ew!
			</p>
			
			<p>
				My great-grandparents from my mother's side — it could be that
				the other ones did so as well,
				but I don't have the confirmation — built their own house and
				later extended it as needed.
				They would gather resources in nearby forests and place rock over rock to make
				their residence. This is something I admire.
				Nevertheless, the house was likely very cold in the winters and had no electricity,
				waterpipes or even a bathroom.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Jobs were not as diverse as they are today.
				There were of course shop owners, farmers, fishers,
				leatherworkers and most of the jobs available for <i>Minecraft</i> villagers;
				mostly physical-work, not mental. One did not follow their innate passion,
				focusing instead on continuing their family business;
				one would have the same job as their parents and learn everything from them.
				Going to school was a waste of time and
				only one or two years of it were needed in order to learn how to read,
				write and count so that one could help their father to check
				whether the payments were correct at the shoe shop.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Why I Think the Present is Better</h3>
			
			<p>
				Let's admit it, they only like those times because of nostalgia;
				the truth is that life was difficult.
				It's naïve to think it would be better to return to that reality.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				At eighteen years of age,
				most young people nowadays are either looking for a job or seeking higher education.
				Most don't imagine how it would be to start working at twelve years of age,
				with food and shelter as the only payment.
				Besides, one's job was not a choice, but rather an obligation.
				Leaving one's parents' home likely meant having to build their own.
				Regardless, these houses would always be freezing cold during the winter and
				boiling hot during the summer.
				Rats could get in as easily as people and diseases would run freely,
				especially amongst the most densely populated areas.
				Do you prefer to start taking backpain medication at sixty or
				die from dysentery at sixteen?
				Do you prefer eating synthetic food with small and highly regulated doses of
				pesticides that will likely never cause any harm to you or
				eating the same vegetables everyday because the crops are not growing?
				Do you prefer to take antidepressants or commit suicide?
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Yes, the present is not anywhere near perfect; it's flawed.
				However, instead of criticising the development of our civilisation,
				let's appreciate the effort and continue to improve our quality of life.
