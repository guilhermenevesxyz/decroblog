			<h2>Elon Musk has just bought Twitter</h2>
			
			<p>published on November 04, 2022</p>
			
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			
			<p>
				Elon Musk has newly bought Twitter and thus become the owner of this massive
				social media platform.
				I know I'm a bit late to comment on this, but I wanted to wait for a while to see how
				the situation would go forward,
				so that I could draw out a better conclusion in the end.
				Now the time has come and I feel confident enough to actually say something.
			</p>
			
			<h3>"The Bird is Freed"</h3>
			
			<p>
				Just after the acquisition, Elon twitted that "the bird is freed",
				which was most likely a hint of what he was planning to do with
				the platform he now owned.
				As freedom is not inherently good or bad — rather,
				it depends on one's personal will — I thought it was worth it to give him a chance,
				even though I was neither faithful nor distrustful.
				One thing I did like to see, though, was his mindset:
				he really had a hankering for a change; he was against some of
				the things people most often grumble about;
				yet, many frowned upon his decisions — and perhaps they were right.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				One of those decisions was to put the blue checkmark behind a paywall.
				Eight dollars a month would get one a checkmarked account,
				which I think is unfair simply because it's not everyone who will be willing or
				even able to pay even such a small amount.
				I don't think it's fair that eight dollars — or any amount of money —
				make one more trustworthy than they are without them.
				As a sidenote, many accounts popped up using Elon Musk's name and profile picture with
				a blue checkmark on them and I must acknowledge
				it was a bit funny to see the things they were posting.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I saw many wander off to Mastodon,
				in search for a better internet home for their microblogposts
				— and I did so as well; not necessarily unhappy with Twitter yet,
				but I wanted to check out both worlds.
				What I found out over time was that Mastodon was actually a much healthier place.
				It uses a decentralised system,
				in which some folks host their own instances with their own rules.
				This way, users join the instance that fits their ideals,
				deeply decreasing the likelyhood of hateful squabbles.
				Elon highlighted the fact that Twitter works like a central square,
				where folks meet to discuss ongoing events and exchange their views,
				whilst having (almost) full freedom to do so.
				Meanwhile, I compare Mastodon to the whole town:
				whilst one can surely discuss their affairs at the central square,
				they can just as much stay at a friend's house and discuss them in there,
				with a chosen set of people.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			
			<p>
				As much as I like Mastodon,
				I must acknowledge that I am pretty sure people won't simply drift towards it;
				Twitter is already settled and will most likely go on being used by most folks.
				I encourage everyone whom this platform is important to
				to do their part, regardless of whatever that means to them
				— even quitting Twitter is acceptable;
				what's important is that people take a stand.
				I don't know whether Elon Musk will turn out to be a good or bad influence,
				but, that's something we'll see in the future.
